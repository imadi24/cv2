      <h1>Karnataka revises its stand on Rohingyas in SC.</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>In less than three weeks after the Karnataka government told the Supreme Court that it does not intend to deport or take any coercive action against Rohingya Muslims, the state government has filed a fresh affidavit, leaving it open for the court to determine the action to be taken against these refugees.
      The state filed its second affidavit in response to a petition filed by a lawyer and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay on October 26. The petition sought an order from the court to identify, detain and deport illegal immigrants and infiltrators including Bangladeshis and Rohingyas within a year.

      The new affidavit filed by KN Vanaja, under secretary in the state Department of Home disclosed that a total of 126 Rohingyas have been identified in the state who were not staying in any camp or detention centre. “This Respondent undertakes that whatever the order that would be passed by this court will be scrupulously adhered to and followed in its letter and spirit,” the affidavit said.

      This affidavit lacked the clear assertion made by the state in its previous affidavit filed on October 7 while responding to the same petition, where it was said, “72 Rohingyas identified in Bengaluru City are working in various fields and Bengaluru City police have not taken any coercive action against them as of now and there is no immediate plan of deporting them.” This affidavit was filed by YS Chandrashekhara, police inspector in the office of the director general and inspector general of police.
