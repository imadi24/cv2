        India captain Virat Kohli is confident that Indian batters have played the likes of Trent Boult and Tim Southee for many years and can counter the New Zealand pace attack in the crucial T20 World Cup game in Dubai on Sunday.
        India captain Virat Kohli said that if Trent Boult is motivated to emulate Shaheen Afridi, then the Indian batters are also confident of countering him in the crucial tie against New Zealand in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup in Dubai on Sunday.

        Indian Premier League teams can retain up to 4 players in the lead up to the mega auction for IPL 2022, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has conveyed in a letter to the franchises. The two new teams who will be part of the
        next season will be allowed to pick 3 players before the auction.
        A source close to the board confirmed the developments to India Today on Saturday. The existing 8 franchises will be allowed to retain their players between November 1 and 30 while the two new teams can pick 3 players from the released list
        of players or elsewhere from December 1. The deadline for picking the set of 3 players for the new teams is December 25.

        The 8 existing teams can't retain more than 3 Indian players (capped or uncapped) while they can't retain more than 2 overseas players. Meanwhile, the two new teams can pick a maximum of 2 Indian players after the players are retained by the
        existing franchises. No more than one uncapped player can be picked by them.
