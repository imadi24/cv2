      <h1>Aryan Khan walks out of Arthur Road Jail after arrest in drugs-on-cruise case, reaches 'Mannat'</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Aryan Khan, Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, stepped out of the Arthur Road Jail on Saturday, after spending four weeks in jail. Khan’s release papers had not reached the jail authorities on time on Friday.

      He had to spend another night in jail after his bail papers missed the 5:30 p.m. deadline yesterday, despite an anxious countdown that went down to seconds.

      Aryan came out of the prison shortly after 11 am, a day after a special court issued his release memo. According to Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail officials, the procedure for the release of Aryan Khan has been completed.
      Immediately after walking out of the prison, he entered a waiting car and drove to his house Mannat in suburban Bandra, 12 km away. Shah Rukh Khan and his wife Gauri Khan left their Bandra house, Mannat, early this morning to be on their way to the Arthur Road Jail.

      Half an hour before Aryan came out, his father's bodyguard got down from a white Range Rover car waiting outside the prison and stood near the facility's gate. He was seen speaking to policemen posted there.

      Around 11 am, the car started moving slowly near the prison's gate and stopped to receive Aryan. The Range Rover was part of the convoy which left Mannat shortly after 8 am and reached a spot in near the prison around 9 am, where it halted to avoid a traffic jam in the area, an official said.

      A large crowd of Shah Rukh Khan's fans had gathered outside the prison since early morning. A sizeable media contingent was also present to cover Aryan's release from the jail.

      Outside the prison, fans and onlookers cheering for Shah Rukh Khan and Aryan and trying to catch a glimpse of the superstar were in for a disappointment as they could not see the actor's face and had to assume that he was in the vehicle.

      Mumbai police, as a precautionary measure to control the crowd, had increased police presence outside the prison, the official said.</p>
