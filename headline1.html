      <p>Narendra Modi in Rome Highlights: Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Saturday that Pope Francis has accepted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s invitation to visit India. “In his own words, he said: ‘You (PM Modi) have given me the greatest gift. I am looking forward to visiting India’,” said Shringla, according to ANI.

      Addressing a press conference in Rome, Shringla said that PM Modi highlighted India’s contribution to fight against Covid-19 during the G20 summit. He added that the PM invited French President Emmanuel Macron to visit India as well.

      On Saturday, PM Modi held meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron  and Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Rome. He is expected to attend a meeting with US President Joe Biden on Sunday.
      Prime Minister Modi has a busy week ahead with high profile meetings at the G20 summit in Italy and the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. He will be in Glasgow on the first two days of November.
      As far as meeting with France President Emmanuel Macron is concerned, I do recall that AUKUS came up but it was not the major subject, there was no discussion on Quad, said Shringla, according to an ANI report.</p>
