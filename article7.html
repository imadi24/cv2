      <p>Tajamul Islam,13, is the first Kashmiri girl to have represented India and won the gold medal — in the under-14 age category — in World Kickboxing Championship held at Cairo in Egypt on October 22 . She was born in Tarkpora, a remote village in north Kashmir’s Bandipora district, 56km from Srinagar.
      A Class 7th student of Army Goodwill School in Bandipora, Tajamul defeated Argentina’s Lalina in the final. “I had represented India in Italy in 2016 too, in the under-9 category. Players from 90 other countries had participated in that championship,” Tajamul told TOI, after returning home. Tajamul said that the championship started on October 18 and concluded on October 24. “I won my gold on October 22. Thirty players from India participated in various age/weight categories,” she said.
      According to Tajamul, she played four bouts in the event —she fought two against players from host country Egypt while her third and fourth bouts were with rivals from France and Argentina respectively. Talking about the final bout, Tajamul said that her rival was very quick in making her moves. “But I kept my cool and it paid off,” she said. Tajamul is the third of the five children of her parents. “My father Ghulam Mohammad Lone is a businessman based in Mumbai but he is back home these days,” she said.
      Tajamul dreams of becoming an orthopaedic surgeon. “I want to break as well as join the bones by becoming a ‘bone and joint’ doctor,” Tajamul laughed. Tajamul is also a brand ambassador of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) scheme. “My mummy always encouraged me and she impressed upon my father to allow me to play the game,” she said. “I feel proud of my daughter. The news of her winning the gold has spread in the area,” Tajmul’s father said.
      “Tajamul got into kickboxing in 2014 when she joined a local academy, which trains young boys and girls in martial arts in Bandipora,” her father said. Islam played four bouts in the event, where she played her first two matches against local players. Her third and fourth bout were against players from France and Argentina, respectively, Times of India reported.

This time in the world championship, she said India had representation from 30 players in different age or weight categories. “I can’t express how proud I feel. It was seriously like ‘kya ye mai hi hun?’ (is it really me?). By doing hard work you can do anything," Islam said in an exclusive interview with News18.

“In Cairo, when my final bout was with Argentina. I had two bouts with Egypt because the participation from there was a lot. They would hoot everytime like ‘Egypt, Egypt’ and it felt so good to beat them when everyone would go quiet.</p>
