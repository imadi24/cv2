      <h1>Christian Eriksen barred from playing for Inter in 2021/22, club open to letting him leave</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Denmark and Inter Milan midfielder Christian Eriksen is not permitted to play in Italy this season as a result of the cardiac arrest he suffered at Euro 2020, his club Inter Milan said in a statement, with the Serie A champions open to letting the Danish midfielder leave.Eriksen suffered a cardiac arrest on the field during his country's opening game of the tournament in June against Finland and received life-saving treatment on the pitch. He later had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) device implanted, a type of pacemaker which can prevent fatal cardiac arrests by discharging a jolt to restore a regular heart rhythm.

      Francesco Braconaro, a member of the Italian Football Federation's technical scientific committee, said in August that Eriksen will not be allowed to play in Italy unless the ICD device is removed.

      "With reference to the registration rights of the player Eriksen, it should be noted that following a serious injury which occurred during the European Championship in June 2021, the player has been temporarily inhibited by the Italian medical authority from sporting activity in the current season," the club wrote in a statement on Thursday.Lionel Messi is the best footballer going around and he doesn't have to win an international title to demonstrate it, according to Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni who, nonetheless, made it clear that that national team will go for glory in the Copa America final against Brazil on Saturday.Lionel Messi has won the Ballon d'Or six times in his glittering career wherein he has won the Champions League and the league title on multiple occasions with Barcelona. Despite having won the Olympic gold in 2008 with Argentina, Messi hasn't been able to inspire the La Albiceleste to a major tournament victory at the highest level.</p>
