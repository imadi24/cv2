      <h1>T20 World Cup: If Boult is motivated to emulate Shaheen, we are motivated to counter him, says Virat Kohli</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Indian skipper Virat Kohli has responded to New Zealand pacer Trent Boult's comments that he will be looking to emulate Shaheen Afridi's heroic spell against India on Sunday (October 31).
      Pakistan pacer Afridi bowled a dream spell against India in their opening game in Dubai on October 24. He ran through the Indian top-order and picked up the important wickets of Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli to help Pakistan script their maiden win against India in a World Cup match.
      Speaking at the pre-match press conference ahead of his side's meeting with India in the Super 12 on Sunday, Boult said he would be looking to mirror what Afridi did against India in Dubai. When asked about Boult's comments, Indian skipper Kohli came up with a fitting response.
      "We are obviously going to come up against quality bowlers. It all depends on how we take the field and the mentality. If he is motivated to emulate Shaheen, we are motivated to counter him. We have played against them for a long time," said Kohli during the pre-match presser in Dubai on Saturday.
      aptain Virat Kohli said that the Indian batters are ready for the battle with Trent Boult in their next T20 World Cup match against New Zealand on Sunday. India suffered a 10-wicket defeat against Pakistan in their opening match where left-arm seamer Shaheen Shah Afridi emerged as a hero with the ball by picking three big wickets of Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Kohli.

  Ahead of the crucial clash, premium New Zealand pacer Boult claims that he will try to emulate’s Shaheen performance on Sunday.

  Skipper Kohli said that his team is motivated to counter Boult if he tries to emulate Shaheen in the mega clash as India have played against New Zealand for a long time.

  “We are obviously going to come up against quality bowlers. It all depends on how we take the field and the mentality. If he is motivated to emulate Shaheen, we are motivated to counter him. We have played against them for a long time," Virat Kohli said in the pre-match presser in Dubai. Meanwhile, some of the Indian batters need to be vary of the key battles with the Kiwi pacers. Tim Southee is going to be the biggest threat for skipper Kohli as he has dismissed him 10 times in international cricket which is the most by any bowler. While Indian openers Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul have struggled against the left-arm seamers which everyone witnessed during the Pakistan clash where Shaheen completely outclassed them. Against New Zealand, the opening duo needs to be cautious against Trent who is one of the best swing bowlers in international cricket at the moment.

Earlier, Boult heaped huge praise on Shaheen for his stellar performance against India and said he will try to swing it around like the Pakistan pacer to trouble Kohli and Co.

“I thought the way Shaheen bowled the other night was amazing. But there are some amazing quality batsmen in the Indian batting line-up. Early wickets are definitely a focus for us as a bowling group. We just need to be nice and clear and accurate when we try to put the ball. Hopefully, from my point of view, it swings around a little bit and I can do what Shaheen did the other night," signed off the 32-year-old.</p>
