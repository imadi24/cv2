      <h1>India sucessfully test fires surface-to-surface ballistic missile Agni-V</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>On Oct 27, 2021, India successfully test-fired Agni-V, a surface-to-surface ballistic missile, was launched from APJ Abdul Kalam Island. This event coincides with the celebration of Infantry Day in India. This year nation celebrates its 75th Infantry Day on Oct 27, 2021. On this day, the 1st Battalion of the SIKH Regiment landed at Srinagar airbase, displayed resoluteness and extraordinary courage, and became ‘The Wall’ to thwart the evil designs of the Pakistan Army who had invaded Kashmir with the help of tribal raiders in 1947. This missile can hit targets up to 5000 km very accurately. It uses a three-stage solid-fuelled engine. Successful launch aligns with India’s policy to have ‘credible minimum deterrence’ that underpins the commitment to ‘No First Use’.

      Agni-V falls broadly in the category of an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). This missile is the bedrock of India’s nuclear deterrent, along with a submarine-based nuclear missile. The initial test of the Agni-V missile was conducted in the year 2012.

      The Agni missile system is a family medium to ICBM, named after one of the elements of nature- Agni, the fire.  Agni missiles are long-range, nuclear weapons capable of surface-to-surface ballistic missiles. The first missile of the series, Agni-I, was developed under the  Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and tested in 1989. Afterward, the Agni missile program was detached from the IGMDP upon realising its strategic importance. It was designated a unique program in India’s defense budget and provided adequate funds for subsequent development. Agni-1 to 5 missiles are designed and developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). So far, Indian Defence Forces have Agni-1 with 700 km range, Agni-2 with 2000 km range, Agni-3 with 2,500 km, and Agni-4 with 3,500 in their weapon system.

      In June, India test-fired the nuclear-capable Agni prime ballistic missile. It is a more advanced form of the Agni class of missile. Agni-VI is an intercontinental ballistic missile stated to be in India’s early stages of development and is being developed by the DRDO. It is to be the state-of-the-art and most cutting-edge version in the Agni missile program. It will be capable of being launched from submarines and land and will have a strike range of 8,000–10,000 km with nuclear warheads.

      The K-family of missiles system, named after Indian scientist and former president APJ Abdul Kalam, is a family of Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBM) developed by India to boost its second-strike capabilities and thus augment its nuclear deterrence. Information about this family of missiles has been chiefly kept classified. It is reported that ‘K missiles’ are faster, lighter and stealthier than their Agni-missiles system.

      DRDO works under the aegis of the Ministry of Defence, Government of India. It is functioning to set-up world-class science and technology base for India and make available our Defence Services conclusive edge by equipping them with internationally competitive systems and solutions. DRDO was established in 1958 after combining the Technical Development Establishment (TDEs) of the Indian Army and the Directorate of Technical Development & Production (DTDP) with the Defence Science Organisation (DSO). Its mission is to design, develop and lead to the production of state-of-the-art sensors, weapon systems, platforms and allied equipment for our Indian Armed Forces. Provide technological solutions to the Services to optimise combat effectiveness and to promote the well-being of the troops. Develop infrastructure and committed quality workforce and build a robust indigenous technology base.

      The Agni, which was conceived initially as a technology demonstrator project was later upgraded to a ballistic missile with different ranges. Dr Kalam played an important role in the growth and operationalisation of Agni and Prithvi missiles. Subsequently, the goal of making India self-reliant in missile technology, DRDO, on Jan 8, 2008, formally announced the successful completion of IGMDP.</p>
