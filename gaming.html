        Cloud9 Blue came out of the gates swinging for the fences on the first map of the series, Ascent. Solid play all around from the Cloud9 Blue players kept the momentum firmly in their favor for the entirety of the first half, only allowing a
        single round to slip through their fingers. The first half ended in an 11-1 scoreline, with the final map score being 13-1 for Cloud9 Blue. But Gen.G didn't let their defeat affect them going into Split. Throughout both halves of regulation,
        there was a constant back-and-forth brawl between the two teams, with neither team able to chain more than three rounds together.

          worth spending diamonds. However, some of them are way too cool to have and can be acquired from the in-game store.
